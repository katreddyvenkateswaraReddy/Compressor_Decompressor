# Compressor Decompressor Project

This project provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application for compressing and decompressing files using the GZIP algorithm. The application allows users to select a file to compress or decompress and provides feedback on the operation's success or failure.

## Features

- Compression: The application can compress a selected file using the GZIP algorithm, reducing its size and saving it as a compressed file with the extension '.gz'.
- Decompression: The application can decompress a selected compressed file (with the '.gz' extension) and restore it to its original state.
- GUI Interface: The application provides a user-friendly interface with buttons for file selection and separate buttons for compression and decompression operations. Feedback messages are displayed to inform the user about the success or failure of the operations.

## Prerequisites
To run the project, you need to have the following:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- An integrated development environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA (optional but recommended).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE or navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Build the project to compile the Java classes.
4. Run the 'Main' class to start the application.
5. The application window will open, showing the title "Compressor-Decompressor" and two buttons: "Select file to compress" and "Select file to decompress".
6. Click the "Select file to compress" button to choose a file you want to compress. After selecting the file, the application will compress it using the GZIP algorithm and display a success or error message.
7. Click the "Select file to decompress" button to choose a compressed file you want to decompress. After selecting the file, the application will decompress it and save the decompressed file. A success or error message will be displayed.
Note: 
The compressed file will be saved in the same directory as the original file, with the extension '.gz'. The decompressed file will be saved in the same directory as the compressed file, without any file extension.
